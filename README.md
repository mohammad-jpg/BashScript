# BashScript
Write a bash script which:
1. Duplicates the directory structure in the source directory to the destination directory.
2. Any .png files in the source should be converted to .jpg in the same location in the
destination directory.
3. The script takes exactly two arguments, source and destination.
4. Source directory remains unchanged.
